## 💡 How It Works

1. Connect your Spotify account via OAuth.
2. Choose the timeframes you want (Short, Medium, Long, or All‑Time).
3. (Optional) Set up an **Apple Shortcuts** automation to refresh your playlists daily.
4. Rewrapped creates/updates your playlists and artwork securely and directly with Spotify.

## 🔐 Privacy & Permissions

* **No data‑collecting backend.** Tokens are stored in the iOS Keychain.
* **Spotify OAuth** is used for authentication.
* With your consent, the app can create, rename, update, replace tracks, and set artwork on your playlists.
* **Artwork is processed on‑device** and uploaded directly to Spotify when you sync.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does it update playlists automatically?**
Yes. Use Apple Shortcuts to schedule daily updates, or refresh manually in the app.

**Do I need Spotify Premium?**
No — Spotify Premium is **not required**.

**What happens when I refresh?**
Each refresh clears previous tracks and repopulates your playlists with the current top songs for the selected ranges. Links stay the same.
